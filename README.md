# An-Analysis-of-Kickstarter-Campaigns
This project was an analysis of Kickstarters in a selectedd year across the world on behalf of Louise to ascertain the best goals for a successful theater based kickstarter. ---
**##The most successful time of the year

+ Here we see that the amount of successful kickstarters doubled in May, continuing to drop over the summer before balancing out at an average baseline.
**##The success of Theater Kickstarters
![OutcomesOfTheater.png](path/to/OutcomesOfTheater.png)
+ Here we see that the outcomes in theater are quite evenly distributed between successful and failed, but now we must determine what is the success rate of specifically plays, as our client is a playwright.
**##The Success of Plays
![OutcomesOfAllPlays.png](path/to/OutcomesOfAllPlays.png)
+ We see a curious fact that kickstarters for plays are highly successful, which can be contributed to the fact they tend to be
+ *1. Smaller goal sizes that seem more "feasible" to the public mind
+ *2. It can be surmised that plays, as very popular medium of entertainment are the most obvious form of seeing the results of your actions thus it feels as if you are truly contributing to something of note
+ *3. There is a far greater garuntee of success for plays than any other category

**##Results
+ It seems based on the successful campaigns, that the wording of who is seeking the funds is the most important, as regardless of goal size, campaigns succeeded in a manner that indicated popular interest above all others - so it seems advantagueous to avise our playwright to focus on a production that will greatly capture public interest, especially as a small group - and success should come if managed wisely.
